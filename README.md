## Easy HTML Exercises

- [Exercise01](https://github.com/authman/htmlhackathon/blob/master/Exercise01.html) Get familiar with the opening and closing tag syntax. Then, give this html page a title, and type something in its body. View the results by opening the rsulting file in your web browser.
- [Exercise02](https://github.com/authman/htmlhackathon/blob/master/Exercise02.html) This time, try adding some `<p>` tags into your HTML body. Be sure to properly indent to keep things readable and legible.
- [Exercise03](https://github.com/authman/htmlhackathon/blob/master/Exercise03.html) Add `<h1>` through `<h6>` tags, a link, a list, and add image to your webpage.


## Intermediate HTML Exercises

- [Exercise04](https://github.com/authman/htmlhackathon/blob/master/Exercise04.html) Create an HTML `<table>` that has 3 columns and 4 rows. The columns should be `id`, `name`, `age`, and `score`. Then fill out the rows with imaginary data.
- [Exercise05](https://github.com/authman/htmlhackathon/blob/master/Exercise05.html) Forms are the most essential part of a webpage. They allow people to submit dynamic content to the server. Build out an HTML `<form>` to allow users to submit a survey about their Hackathon experience.


## Even "More" Intermediate HTML / CSS Exercises

- [Exercise06](https://github.com/authman/htmlhackathon/blob/master/Exercise06.html) Read through the HTML file provided. Proprly assign class and id's to the `<div>` tags in the file and see if doing so alters how they look like when rendered in your browser. Also add a bunch of `<p>` tags into the final `<div>` on the page. BONUS: Try nesting a few `<div>`.

- [Exercise07](https://github.com/authman/htmlhackathon/blob/master/Exercise07.html) What does the new child tag placed in `<head>` do? Open up that file (Exercise07.css) and try altering the CSS values. Be sure to save your file then refresh Exercise07.html in your browser.

- [Exercise08](https://github.com/authman/htmlhackathon/blob/master/Exercise08.html) Try adding `display:block` or `display:inline`, or `display:inline-block` to your CSS selectors to see how their default behavior is altered.
