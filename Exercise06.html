	<div>
		Each element in an HTML document has its own intrinsic style. For example, `h1` - `h6` tags are always bold, large, and have a lot of padding around them.
	</div>

	<div>
		Another example would be links. Without explicitly specifying their color, they naturally appear as underlined blue text.
	</div>

	<div>
		Div's also have some properties; but for the most part, they behave like `paragraph` tags. Although you can nest `p` tags inside of one another, it's better form to wrap multiple paragraph tags in a `div`.
